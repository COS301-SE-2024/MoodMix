## General Overview

Five Dudes Capstone Project.

The rise of large language models like ChatGPT has had a
massive impact on the integration of artificial intelligence into
everyday life. Music forms an integral part of our lives and we
do not always realize this. At Five Dudes, we are excited about
the potential to merge artificial intelligence with a service used
by billions around the world.
Our goal is to harness the use of artificial intelligence to
streamline the music listening experience for users
everywhere. MoodMix allows us to do just that.

| **Role:** | Backend and Database engineer 
| **Bio:** |I am a final year Computer Science 
student with a deep interest in all 
things data science and AI. After 
watching Garry Kasparov vs Deep 
Blue for the first time, my fascination 
for computers and AI models started. 
I was determined to one day be able 
to implement my own AI models. 
This is ultimately what led to me 
studying Computer Science.
I am goal-oriented and determined 
to finish what I start. I try to ensure 
that the things I do I do to the best of 
my capabilities and to the highest of 
quality. My strong work ethic is 
complemented by robust problemsolving skills that I try to apply to all 
aspects of my life. I am comfortable 
using the technologies listed below, 
but I am always eager to expand my 
repertoire.
